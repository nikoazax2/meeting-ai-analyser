## r/opensource

**Title:** Stop copy-pasting your meetings into Claude. I made an open-source tool that does it automatically.

Captures all PC audio (speakers + mic), transcribes locally, then Claude CLI on your machine generates structured notes every 60s. Topics, decisions, action items, live dashboard.

Full source on GitHub, single .exe, no install, no account. Works with Teams, Zoom, Meet, Discord, or any video/podcast playing on your PC.

## r/software

**Title:** Stop copy-pasting your meetings into Claude. This open-source tool does it in real time.

Just launch it next to your video call. It captures everything playing on your PC (what others say, what you say), transcribes locally, then Claude CLI analyzes the text every minute.

Open source, free while it's early. If it grows it'll become paid. No account, no bot in your call, single .exe.

## r/webdev

**Title:** Stop pasting meeting transcripts into Claude. I built a Python tool that does it live. Open source.

WASAPI loopback + mic capture, real-time transcription via faster-whisper, Claude CLI analysis every 60s, results streamed to a local web dashboard via SSE. Bundled as a single .exe with PyInstaller.

Open source and free for now since it's new. If enough people use it, it'll go paid eventually.

Also works on training videos, webinars, YouTube. Open source, free for now.

## r/freelance

**Title:** Stop copy-pasting your client calls into Claude. I built a tool that does it live. Open source.

Client calls used to eat my time twice: once for the meeting, once for writing up the notes. Now I just launch this next to my call and it captures everything, transcribes locally, and Claude generates structured summaries every minute. Decisions, action items, key topics.

Works with any call app. Open source, free while it's early. Will probably go paid if it grows.

## r/machineLearning

**Title:** Stop pasting transcripts into Claude manually. Real-time pipeline: faster-whisper + Silero VAD + Claude CLI.

WASAPI loopback + mic mixed to mono 16kHz, faster-whisper (CTranslate2 CUDA fp16 / CPU int8 fallback), Silero VAD v6 ONNX for speech detection, Claude CLI for structured analysis every 60s. Results streamed via Flask SSE to a local dashboard.

Open source, free while the project is new. Looking for feedback on the pipeline.
